## Known Game Fixes

This repo keeps track of known fixes for games (currently we are tracking only winetricks fixes) running with Heroic Games Launcher.

Note that this information applies to using up to date versions of the different tools. Make sure to use the latest version of Heroic and Wine-GE-Proton.

Keep in mind that some games may need extra fixes and not only winetricks, and that information is not yet mapped here.

## Collaborations

1. Add a JSON file following the file name convention with the list of winetricks packages and the game title as the content
2. Update this README adding the title of the game to the Store's list in alphabetical order

### Filename

`<appName>-<store>.json` where appName is the appName used by Heroic and store is one of `epic`, `gog`, or `amazon`

### JSON content

```json
{
  "title": "Alan Wake's American Nightmare",
  "winetricks": ["d3dcompiler_47", "vcrun2019"]
}
```

The value of the `winetricks` property is an array of the names that Winetricks understands.

### Removals

When a fix is not needed anymore, remove the json file and strike-through the title in the Readme with a mention of why it's removed if the reason is known.
